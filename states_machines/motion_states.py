#TODO: Put the motion States Machines in this file
# Examples of such states are:
# - Spin State
# - Wait State or Stop State
# - MoveDown State
# - MoveUp State
# - MoveLeft State
# - MoveRight State
# - MoveForward State
# - MoveBackward State
# - MoveToTarget State

# These States Machines need to implement the MoveIt Planning Interface
